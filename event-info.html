      		<p><strong>Information regarding the directions of the main race</strong></p>
           <p>
            This next iteration of the race in 2022, will be the first time we will have a direction identified as the 'Championship' race direction. <br />
            This race is a specific direction around the main course for the purpose of letting those who are competitive know what race to enter in order to test themselves against each other. <br />
            In order to place on the podium and qualify for category prizes, you must enter the 'Championship' race. <br />
            The final results will include every runner, regardless of the direction they chose to race. <br />
            You are still welcome to race any direction you wish, provided we do not hit the limit of 120 per direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not apply to the hooper loop as there is one direction, all runners in that race qualify for the podium and category prizes.
