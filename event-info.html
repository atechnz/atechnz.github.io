        <h2 id="race-directions-heading">Information regarding the directions of the main race</h2>
        <p>
          You can choose what direction you want to run the main race in, but for the purpose of matching the front of the field in the same race, we have chosen a specific direction for those who want to podium.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year the podium direction is the <b>Holdsworth→Jumbo (Clockwise) direction.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to place on the podium and qualify for category prizes, you will need to enter the 'Holdsworth→Jumbo Direction'
          race.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final results will include every runner, regardless of the direction they chose to race, with your
          direction noted. Every competitor is eligible to win a spot prize.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Hooper Loop has just one direction. All runners in that race qualify for the podium and category prizes in that race.

        <h2>Race Rules - please read</h2>
        <p>The Jumbo Holdsworth Trail race proudly has an AdventureMark certified Safety Plan. <br />
          Please follow all the rules below in order to help us make this event as safe as possible.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Competitors must carry their mandatory gear requirements - as listed above.</li>
          <li>Race referees reserve the right to withdraw any competitors deemed to be at risk.</li>
          <li>The Jumbo-Holdsworth Trail Race will have a <b>strict cut-off time of 2 hrs 20 minutes enforced at Jumbo
              Hut, any competitor taking longer will not be allowed to continue.</b> However, if a competitor fails to
            reach the Atiwhakatu hut in 1hr 10mins they will be withdrawn at that point also.</li>
          <li>The Holdsworth-Jumbo Trail Race will have a <b>strict cut-off time of 1 hr 50 minutes enforced at Powell
              Hut</b>. <b>Any competitor taking longer will not be allowed to continue.</b></li>
          <li>Competitors must be responsible for the safety of other competitors. Anyone encountering another in
            difficulty must offer assistance, and then notify the nearest race official so that help can be actioned. A
            time adjustment will be offered for your assistance - this applies to both races.</li>
          <li>Competitors on the Jumbo-Holdsworth direction may encounter a wait at the 1st swing bridge as there is a
            limit of 1 person at a
            time to cross. Marshals will help move people across as fast as possible</li>
          <li>Competitors on the Holdsworth-Jumbo may arrive at that swing bridge together. If you are
            racing and you arrive together (within sight of each other), then you should wait for the other competitor to cross
            before racing again.
          </li>
          <li>All runners are to remain on established tracks and not damage vegetation by setting your own course.</li>
          <li>All competitors to display race numbers clearly at all times, especially at checkpoints and the finish
            (please as it makes it very difficult for timing otherwise!).</li>
          <li>All food and wrappings are to be carried on a "pack in - pack out" basis. Any runner reported discarding
            rubbish purposefully will be disqualified.</li>
          <li>Please be a tidy runner and pick up any rubbish you see.</li>
          <li>Any competitor pulling out of either event for any reason after race start MUST report to the race
            director or timing tent at race control before leaving the park so their absence can be accounted for.</li>
          <li>The Tararua Forest park will be open and operating, so please be careful and considerate of other track
            users.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>For the main race, all competitors to be over the age of 18yrs as at 24/01/2026 or at the organisers
            discretion.</li>
          <li>For the Hooper Loop race, all competitors to be over the age of 14yrs as at 24/01/2026 or at the
            organisers discretion.</li>

              All events are in the mountains, and the mountains carry a large element of risk. Weather, underfoot conditions, and the strenuous nature of the event can all cause problems. <br />
              You must be as prepared as possible when you enter this race:
              <li>Familiarise yourself with the course as much as possible</li>
              <li>Check your gear meets the mandatory requirements and make sure you bring it along</li>
              <li>Get fit and confident - for the main race, expect to take about as long as you would run a marathon - yes its that hard.</li>
